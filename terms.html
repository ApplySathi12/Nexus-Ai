        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to Nexus! These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for the use of Nexus's Website, located at [Your Website URL].</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. Accounts and Membership</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">When you create an account with us, you must provide us with information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">2. Free Trial</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">We offer a one-time 3-day free trial to new users. To prevent abuse of our free trial system, we employ certain measures to ensure that each user can only access the free trial once.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">By signing up for a free trial, you agree that we may collect and process a unique device identifier (device fingerprint) and your IP address. This information is used solely for the purpose of identifying unique users and preventing fraudulent sign-ups. An attempt to circumvent this system by using VPNs or other technologies to create multiple accounts is a violation of these terms and will result in the immediate termination of all associated accounts.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The Service and its original content, features and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Nexus and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the India and foreign countries.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">4. Termination</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">5. Changes To Terms</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
